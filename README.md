# FatigueCalc

A simple [HDT](http://hsdecktracker.net) plugin that calculates how many turns a player has in a non-complex fatigue war.
The calculations are based on [tominko's "Who dies first? A fatigue table." post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/3xkm3k/who_dies_first_a_fatigue_table/).

## Installation
- Then unzip the into the HDT Plugins directory (this directory can be opened with `options > plugins > plugins folder` button)
- The directory should look like `Plugins/FatigueCalc/[some files]`
- Enable the plugin from `Options/Plugins` menu
